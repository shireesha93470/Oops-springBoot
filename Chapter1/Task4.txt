Q)Customized Itinerary: Design a travel itinerary for a friend who has different preferences than you. How
would you ensure that your base plan (OOP) can be adapted to fit their needs (Design Principles)?

***Encapsulation:
    Imagine when you travel, there's a rule that says you can't carry too much stuff.
     Encapsulation is like putting your things in a special bag where only you can open it. 
     Others can't mess with your things directly.

 ***Abstraction:
    Visas are like special permission slips to enter different countries. 
    Abstraction is like not worrying about all the complicated rules to get a visa. 
    Instead, you just talk to the visa office, and they handle the hard stuff, making it easier for you.

***Inheritance:
   Airlines have their own rules for booking tickets. Inheritance is like when different 
   types of tickets (like first class and economy) follow some basic booking rules. First 
   class tickets can add or change a few rules, but they still follow the main ones.

 ***Polymorphism:
   Hotels have different times when you can check in. Polymorphism is like being ready to adapt
    to different check-in times. You might arrive at a hotel at any time, and you adjust your plans
     without knowing the exact check-in time until you get there.
