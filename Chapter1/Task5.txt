Q)Reflect on Dependencies: Think about all the services and tools youâ€™d rely on during your Swiss journey,
from travel agencies to GPS apps. How do these dependencies relate to the Dependency Inversion Principle
in software design?

Imagine you're going on a trip to Switzerland. Your big plan and checklist for the trip are 
like the most important things.

***High-level dependencies:
 are like the really important stuff you need for your whole trip, like your plan and checklist.

***Low-level dependencies :
are like the smaller things that help make your trip happen, such as the things you need while traveling.

***Abstraction :
is a bit like using services that make your travel easier, like travel agencies and GPS apps. 
They take care of the complicated stuff for you.
