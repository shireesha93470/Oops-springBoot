Q)Journey Extension: Imagine extending your Swiss journey to neighboring countries. How would you adapt
your travel checklist? Relate this to the concept of inheritance and polymorphism in software design.

Ans)
1.Travel Documents:we have not only passport but also the necessary visas or permits for the countries you plan to visit. 
Each country  have different requirements.
2.Currency: we have to check the currency of countries if we want currency we have to exchange.
3.Language:we have to learn the languages spoken in the  countries to help with communication.

***polymorphism:Imagine your journey as a base trip to Switzerland (the base class). Now, when you 
decide to extend your trip to neighboring countries, it's like inheriting the qualities of your 
base trip. You still have the same starting point and some common attributes, like your travel 
documents and luggage, but you're adding new elements specific to each country you visit.

***inheritance:When you travel to different neighboring countries, you adapt to each country's unique 
language, currency, and customs.  different countries have differentlanguages so if we want to go one country we have to know basic 
language so that we will interact with people.
