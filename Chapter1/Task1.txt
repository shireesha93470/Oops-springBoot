Q) Map Creation: Think of a real-world system, like a library or a shopping mall. How would you model it
using OOP concepts? What are the objects, their attributes, and behaviors? How do they interact?

Ans) For Map creation i am taking shopping mall as an example 

***Encapsulation:In a shopping mall, encapsulation means securing  the important information about each 
store and shopper so that it's not easily accessible to everyone. By using encapsulation, we ensure 
that sensitive information in the mall's system is protected and only accessed in a controlled manner, 
making the mall's operation more secure and organized.

***Inheritance:Inheritance in a shopping mall example is like passing  certain qualities from one group 
of people to another, like from parents to children.for example if we can take one person that person 
is the base class in shopping mall we have one group of people for them we have to give one name and an age
etc these are common qualities for all of them.and in sub class we have to take employee they also have their
name and age from regular people, but they have one extra quality , like an employee ID, because they have 
a special role in the mall. 

***Polymorphism:Imagine a payment system in a mall. People can pay in different ways, like with cash or a 
credit card. Polymorphism is like having a single payment machine that can accept any type of payment method.
For example, when you want to pay, you go to the payment machine and say, "I want to pay." You don't care if 
it's a credit card machine or a cash machine; you just know it will handle your payment.

***Abstraction:In a shopping mall example, abstraction is like using a vending machine to buy snacks. You don't 
need to know how the machine is built or how it delivers the snacks. Instead, you just interact with its buttons 
and get the snacks you want.
